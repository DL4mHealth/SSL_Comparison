# Self-Supervised Learning for Time Series: Contrastive or Generative?

We are committed to making our research accessible and plan to release the dataset and corresponding implementation code used in our comparative study of contrastive and generative self-supervised learning methods.

In a pursuit of thoroughness and relevance, we pledge to continually enhance our comparative study. This will be achieved by incorporating an increasing quantity and diversity of datasets and by integrating more cutting-edge methodologies into our evaluation.
